Hello Pipedrive,

When I first heard about the opportunity to apply for a Junior Infrastructure Engineer position at Pipedrive, 
it made me think "I really want to work there". I am very excited about your product and how it's still changing the industry.
I have long been awaiting such an opportunity to rise in such an established SaaS comapny.

I haven't worked on such a big project before but I think my enthusiasm and willingness to learn will cover all the bases quite rapidly. 
Right now I am working on a project that I built myself from the ground up that's in the financial ballpark.
I am really happy to even have a chance to apply to such an industry-changing company.

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Mario Muuk
