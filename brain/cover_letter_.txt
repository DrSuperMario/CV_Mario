Hello Shuttle99,

When I first heard about the opportunity to apply for a Python web developer intern at shuttle99, 
I knew i would like to apply. I have long been awaiting such an opportunity to rise in such an established fintech comapny.

I haven't worked on many projects before but I think my enthusiasm and willingness to learn will cover all the bases quite rapidly. 
Right now I am working on a project that I built myself from the ground up that's in the financial ballpark..

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Mario Muuk
